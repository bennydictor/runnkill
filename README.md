Thank you for playing runnkill!


You have to run server and then client <your ip>
Multiplayering enabled.
Try not to kill yourself!

Thank Siriocra for help and support!

Controls:

* WASD - movement
* Space - jump

* 1-9   - skills
* IKLO  - Shields
* Shift - RUN!!

In directory Dependencies you can find all what you need;
If you want to build the binary manually, run make.
If you have problems with compiling, in client/.make/config.mk replace glfw with glfw3 in line 2

Following libraries are required:

* Any OpenGL implementation
* Glfw
* GLEW
* freetype2

For your own server configuring, look files in directory server. 
There are "skills", "materials", etc.
